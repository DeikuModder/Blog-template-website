Hello there, here's my first template for a website, it's a portfolio, i made it so it'd be for general purposes, wich means it has nothing that you can relate to an specific workfield.

Please keep in mind this is my first complete website template, madre from 0, so it may not look so professional yet.

[What-i-learned]

-Improved my skills and productivity in general
-Making this website helped me gain a better understanding on displays and positions.
-To center boxes in diferent effective ways.
-Make gradient borders and background, using background and border image properties.
-Improved my responsive designs, since i made it with the mobile-design-first workflow, wich currentyl is the one that i prefer
-Improved my navigation bars
-Get a better understanding on transitions and transforms.
